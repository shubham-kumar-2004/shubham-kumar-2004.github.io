      hey, i'm shubham. i study at nit trichy, majoring in instrumentation and control engineering, which honestly i suck at. i'll graduate in 2026, and if things go to plan, i'll be off chasing a master's in hci/ixd or something close to that.
    </p>
    
    <p class="text-muted-foreground">
      i design, i build, i tweak the small stuff till it feels right. i care about clean ui, thoughtful motion, and the invisible details people skip over. i learn by messing around, doing things the hard way, and figuring it out mid-project.
    </p>

    <p class="text-muted-foreground">
      i'm into lossless audio and music that hits just right. probably spent more than i should've on audio gear. no regrets. i like cars (dream is an m340i with a miltek exhaust) and read about planes for fun. sometimes i go planespotting. it's kinda peaceful.
    </p>

    <p class="text-muted-foreground">
      in college, most people stick to the roadmap. i didn't. got into design through side projects, long nights figuring stuff out, and saying yes before i knew what i was doing. no real plan, just curiosity. for a while, i thought everyone else had it figured out. clean paths, big titles, shiny wins. i was just messing around, building things, getting stuff wrong, and hearing "this won't work" now and then.
    </p>

    <p class="text-muted-foreground">
      but the more people i met, the more i realized most of it is just noise. it's not always as polished as it looks. and honestly, that made it easier to keep doing my thing.
    </p>

    <p class="text-muted-foreground">
      i don't have a big vision or a five-year plan. i just try to make things that feel honest and don't suck. that's enough.
    </p>

    <p class="text-muted-foreground">
      aside from all that, i've always had a strong curiosity about the world. travel, and the mix of experiences that come with different places, cultures, and landscapes, has shaped a lot of how i think and grow.
